# ðŸ“± KivyMD Playground ðŸ“±

These are some examples of the tools I've built using Kivy and KivyMD. Each section includes a python file and a .kv file which contains
the formatting and layout of each screen. To display the screen, you must run the .py file, not the .kv file. 
Feel free to use any of these examples for building your kivy projects!
